\begin{abstract}
Reducing the number of duplicate images uploaded to public servers is an ever more relevant problem as the number of images shared increases dramatically every day. Methods of data reduction such as file expiration dates only lessen this load by a small amount while common methods of image matching are in many cases resource exhaustive, time consuming, or highly inaccurate. This research utilizes technologies capable of identifying near-duplicate images through file hashing, pixel difference, and histogram comparisons. In order to evaluate the feasibility of implementing such a system, a basic photo sharing website has been developed and run on a fixed collection of images. This system was then empirically evaluated with a focus on accuracy and performance with results suggesting acceptable performance and detection rates.
