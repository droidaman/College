Reducing the number of duplicate images uploaded to public servers is an ever more relevant problem as the number of images shared increases dramatically every day. Methods of data reduction such as file expiration dates only lessen this load by a small amount while common methods of image matching are in many cases resource exhaustive, time consuming, or highly inaccurate. This research aims to derive an algorithm capable of identifying near-duplicate images through file hashing, pixel difference, and histogram comparisons. In order to test the feasibility of implementing such an algorithm, a basic photo sharing website has been developed and tested on a fixed collection of images.
