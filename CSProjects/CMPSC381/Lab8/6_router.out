How many routers? 6
Network (a weight of "--" means "no edge"):
A : (A,--)  (B,1)  (C,--)  (D,4)  (E,6)  (F,2) 
B : (A,1)  (B,--)  (C,6)  (D,6)  (E,10)  (F,10) 
C : (A,--)  (B,6)  (C,--)  (D,6)  (E,8)  (F,4) 
D : (A,4)  (B,6)  (C,6)  (D,--)  (E,4)  (F,--) 
E : (A,6)  (B,10)  (C,8)  (D,4)  (E,--)  (F,--) 
F : (A,2)  (B,10)  (C,4)  (D,--)  (E,--)  (F,--)

Current best distances from 0:
  distance to B = 1 (previous = A )
  distance to C = infinity
  distance to D = 4 (previous = A )
  distance to E = 6 (previous = A )
  distance to F = 2 (previous = A )

Which router should I add next? b

Current best distance from A to B is 1

There is an edge of weight 6 from router B to router C
Update the distance from A to C  using B ? (y=yes, anything else = no)
y
okay, changing distance to C ; new distance = 7 ; changing previous to B

There is an edge of weight 6 from router B to router D
Update the distance from A to D  using B ? (y=yes, anything else = no)
n

There is an edge of weight 10 from router B to router E
Update the distance from A to E  using B ? (y=yes, anything else = no)
n

There is an edge of weight 10 from router B to router F
Update the distance from A to F  using B ? (y=yes, anything else = no)
