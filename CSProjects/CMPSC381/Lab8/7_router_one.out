Which router should I add next? b

Current best distance from A to B is 5

There is an edge of weight 1 from router B to router C
Update the distance from A to C  using B ? (y=yes, anything else = no)
n

There is an edge of weight 2 from router B to router D
Update the distance from A to D  using B ? (y=yes, anything else = no)
y
okay, changing distance to D ; new distance = 7 ; changing previous to B

There is an edge of weight 5 from router B to router F
Update the distance from A to F  using B ? (y=yes, anything else = no)
y
okay, changing distance to F ; new distance = 10 ; changing previous to B

There is an edge of weight 9 from router B to router G
Update the distance from A to G  using B ? (y=yes, anything else = no)
