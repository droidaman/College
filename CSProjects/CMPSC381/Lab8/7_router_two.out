Which router should I add next? c

Current best distance from A to C is 3

There is an edge of weight 10 from router C to router B
Update the distance from A to B  using C ? (y=yes, anything else = no)
y
okay, changing distance to B ; new distance = 13 ; changing previous to C

There is an edge of weight 2 from router C to router D
Update the distance from A to D  using C ? (y=yes, anything else = no)
y
okay, changing distance to D ; new distance = 5 ; changing previous to C

There is an edge of weight 1 from router C to router E
Update the distance from A to E  using C ? (y=yes, anything else = no)
y
okay, changing distance to E ; new distance = 4 ; changing previous to C

There is an edge of weight 9 from router C to router F
Update the distance from A to F  using C ? (y=yes, anything else = no)
