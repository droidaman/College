            \item Silberschatz et al.\ observe that ``practically all
              use of databases occurs from within application
              programs'' \mbox{[Data. Sys. Conc. 2010]}

            \item Database applications rapidly evolve as changes are
              made to both the program and the database's state and
              structure

%% Moreover, many database applications rapidly evolve as software
%% developers change the source code, database administrators modify the
%% database's schema, and external application programs add data to and
%% delete data from the database.

            \item $\mbox{RFFS}(T, T') = (|T|-|T'|) \div |T|$

            \item ST has the best RFFS (.69 avg) and GB has the worst
              (.36 avg)

            \item Across all of the applications, RFFS was .51 on
              average at the relation level and .44 on average at the
              attribute value level

            \item RFFS drops from .50 to .40 when the reducer analyzes
              at the record level instead of the attribute level

            \item RFFS climbs to .44 from .40 with attribute value
              requirements

                time}}(T')) \div \mbox{{\em time}}(T)$

            \item GB has the highest RFFT value because it contains
              redundant tests that restart the database and are thus
              very costly to run

            \item Except for GB, the RFFT values are lower than those
              for RFFS

            %% \item For all of the applications, RFFS was .28 on average
            %%   at the relation level and .24 on average at the
            %%   attribute value level

            \item RFFS was .28 on average at the relation level and
              .24 on average at the attribute value level, across all
              of the applications

            %% \item RFFS decreases from .28 to .23 when the reducer
            %%   analyzes at the record level instead of the attribute
            %%   level

            \item When the reducer analyzes at the record level
              instead of the attribute value level, RFFS decreases
              from .28 to .23

            \item With attribute value requirements RFFS increases to
              .24 from .23
