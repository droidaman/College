      	  \begin{itemize}
          
            \item There was approximately 2.8 billion terabytes of data in the world as of January 2012.

            \item Approximately 5\% of the world's data is redundant.
            
            \item Collectively, businesses spend \$1.8 trillion annually to store data.
            
            \item By removing even 1\% of the redundant data, that is an annual savings of \$18 billion dollars.

            \item Remove duplicate files and replace duplicate with pointer referring to the parent copy

            \item Overwrite opened pointer with modified file to prevent overwriting a needed original.

            \item Restrict file database to non-system files.
